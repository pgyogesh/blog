In November, I moved to Hyderabad from Banglore where there is no issue of transportation but in Hyderbad its terrific. I was staying in 100 feet road. My office was just 3Km away from my room. And daily I used to travel by Auto Rickshaws because there was no bus service from TSRTC on my way to office. And almost all rickshaw drivers don't follow traffic signal here. After seeing few road accidents by Auto rickshaw drivers. I decided to get own bike. Now I had a big question *Which Bike?*

I had below few options

  * Yamaha FZ25

  * Honda Hornet

  * And of course my brother's favourite Royal Enfield Classic 350

I spent lot of time on watching review videos on youtube of all the new bikes in mrket but review of Yamaha FZ250 by Sagar Sheldekar of Power Drift for my attraction and I went test drive in Pearl Yamaha, Gachhibowli(HYD). As I entered into their showroom new Yamaha FZ250 with great muscles. I did test drive around 3-4 Km. The bike was very smooth to drive and handling was best for city rides. After this ride I had only two options FZ25 and Royal Enfield Classic 350. And also, as I was looking for light weight and fuel friendly bike, I decided to go with Black Colour YAMAHA FZ250.


And sunrised, I was very excited to recieve the bike. Me and my friend Mrunal went to showroom, completed all the formalities and took the beast home.
